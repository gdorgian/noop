## What this fork adds

NOOP AI stays close to [RyanBR's NOOP](https://github.com/ryanbr/noop) for the strap protocol,
on-device analytics, storage and shared design system. The code below is the additional,
Apple-first layer maintained in this fork:

### 🤖 A real coaching system, not just a chat box

A configurable identity and coaching style, streaming replies, model-specific history budgets and
26 consent-gated tools that can read local summaries, explain readiness, draw charts, propose plans
and write only the logs you explicitly request. Provider connections support Anthropic, OpenAI,
Gemini, OpenRouter and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints with your own key; tool calling is enabled
where the selected provider and model support it. [Coach architecture →](docs/fork/COACH.md)

### 🧠 Private long-term memory on the device

Hybrid keyword and semantic retrieval over approved facts, your own chat turns and selected journal
context. The Nomic embedding model runs locally on iPhone; raw sensor streams and numerical health
histories are never embedded. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and the derived index can be
rebuilt or deleted. [SemanticMemory package →](Packages/SemanticMemory/)

### 🎯 Goals, Journey and a plan you control

One structured goal with feasibility and safety checks, progress based on actual evidence, milestones
without invented streaks, and weekly proposals you can accept, decline, reschedule, swap or skip.
A model proposal never silently becomes your schedule.

### 🔐 Purpose-by-purpose data consent

Essentials, Personal and Deep Insights presets make setup simple; Expert mode exposes the individual
grants. Sensitive journal topics always require a separate decision, and unavailable grants remove
the corresponding tools before a request is sent. [Privacy model →](docs/PRIVACY_SECURITY.md)

### 🔔 Proactive coaching with a local history

Optional daily briefs, check-ins and goal reviews live in the Coach; plan proposals and important
body/goal signals also feed the in-app bell, so useful events remain visible even when iOS cannot
show a notification banner.

### 🧪 Review-first health workflows

Lab reports can be read from a text PDF or on-device photo OCR, but only recognised marker candidates
you confirm become Lab Book entries. Files, OCR text and unconfirmed values are not retained.

### 🍎 Apple-first interface and distribution

A redesigned Today experience, configurable Coach entry points, compact-iPhone chat handling,
fork-added surfaces covering upstream's full Apple language matrix, and an unsigned AltStore/SideStore
release that is signed only with the Apple ID you choose.

The upstream base and the fork additions remain intentionally separated in code so upstream protocol,
analytics and safety fixes can continue to be merged without rewriting the coaching layer.

## Latest release — 10.1.1

A launch-performance and analysis-correctness release for large, long-lived local databases.

- **The first screen no longer waits for the archive.** NOOP publishes a bounded 120-day snapshot,
  then runs plan, goal, HealthKit and historical maintenance work after the interface is usable.
- **Changed inputs invalidate the right days.** R-R, PPG heart rate, respiration, motion, steps,
  temperature, SpO₂, wrist/sleep state and edited sleep now participate alongside measured heart rate.
- **Dense streams keep their newest samples.** The silent 200,000-row ceiling is gone, and the largest
  repeated sleep/recovery array scans have been replaced with sorted slices and one-pass buckets.

Read the full [10.1.1 release notes](docs/fork/releases/v10.1.1.md).

Before it: [10.1.0](docs/fork/releases/v10.1.0.md) brought the fork onto the 10.x line with custom
heart-rate zones, arithmetic-checked coach prescriptions and the complete upstream 10.1.0 base.

## In development

- **Android is not shipped by this fork.** The Android tree was removed after the fork moved to an
  Apple-only release pipeline. RyanBR's upstream project remains the source for Android development.
- **More practical alert history.** The inbox will keep evolving around events that actually happened,
  rather than becoming a second copy of scheduled reminders.

## Download and install

### iPhone and iPad

The iOS build is an **unsigned IPA on purpose**. Add the source below in AltStore or SideStore, then
the sideloader signs the app locally with the Apple ID you choose. NOOP AI never receives your Apple ID
or a signing certificate.

**Source URL:**

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DX23876/noop/main/altstore-source.json
```

- **AltStore:** Browse → **+** → paste the source URL → add NOOP AI.
- **SideStore:** Sources → **+ Add Source** → paste the same URL → install NOOP AI.
- Prefer a direct file? Download `NOOP-ios-unsigned-v10.1.1-dx.ipa` from the
  [10.1.1 release](https://github.com/DX23876/noop/releases/tag/v10.1.1-dx). It includes the
  Home/Lock-Screen **widgets**, which AltStore/SideStore sign along with the app.
- Need the **Apple Watch** app? The same release also contains
  `NOOP-ios-full-unsigned-v10.1.1-dx.ipa`, which adds the Watch app and complication. It wants a
  signer or paid Developer team that can provision all of it together — sideloaders install an
  embedded watchOS bundle unreliably, and a failure there costs you the whole install, which is why
  the AltStore source stays on the watch-less IPA.

See [the iOS install guide](docs/IOS.md) for the free-Apple-ID limits, widget notes, and build-from-source
instructions.

### Mac

From 9.3.0 the release carries a packaged macOS build: download
`NOOP-macos-v10.1.1-dx.zip` from the
[10.1.1 release](https://github.com/DX23876/noop/releases/tag/v10.1.1-dx), unzip it, then
**right-click → Open** the first time (it is ad-hoc signed, not notarised, so a double-click is blocked).

The bundle is universal — Apple Silicon and Intel. Ad-hoc signing is what lets macOS bind the Bluetooth
permission to the app; after an update macOS may ask you to re-approve Bluetooth, because the code
identity changes with every build.

### Platform status

| Platform | Status | Distribution |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / iPadOS | 10.1.1 | AltStore, SideStore, or build from source |
| macOS | 10.1.1 | Packaged `.zip` in the release, or build with Xcode |
| Android | Not shipped by this fork | Use RyanBR's upstream Android project |

## The NOOP foundation retained

| | |
|---|---|
| ⌚ **Own your strap data** | Connect directly to a WHOOP 4.0 or 5.0/MG over Bluetooth. No WHOOP account, subscription, or cloud relay. |
| 📈 **Compute locally** | Charge, Effort, Rest, sleep, HRV, heart rate, recovery trends, and correlations are calculated and stored on your device. |
| 🔒 **Keep control** | No telemetry, no NOOP account, and no NOOP server. Network access is limited to explicit features: your chosen Coach provider, an optional source-built Oura import, and the manual public-release check. |
| 📬 **See what happened** | Today and the bell keep daily signals, important status, and recent alerts visible without turning every event into noise. |

## Privacy, precisely

NOOP AI is offline-first. Your strap data, database, scores, history, goals, coach memory, and plans
stay on your device. The optional AI Coach contacts only the provider you configure when you ask it
to; a source-built Oura history lane can pull your own Oura data in; and **Check for updates** reads
only the latest public release metadata when you tap it. None of these paths uploads raw sensor
streams or gives NOOP a server or account.

More detail: [Privacy and security](docs/PRIVACY_SECURITY.md).

## Build from source

You need a Mac with Xcode 26+ and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DX23876/noop.git NOOP-AI
cd NOOP-AI
xcodegen generate
open Strand.xcodeproj
```

- Choose **NOOPiOS** and a physical iPhone to build iOS.
- Choose **Strand** to build macOS.
- For Android development, use [RyanBR's upstream project](https://github.com/ryanbr/noop).

## About the project

NOOP AI is a personal fork of [ryanbr/noop](https://github.com/ryanbr/noop). The upstream project
deserves credit for the protocol, analytics, and design-system foundations; this fork develops the
local coach and Apple-first sideload distribution independently. It is an unofficial, non-commercial
interoperability project and is not affiliated with WHOOP.

## Disclaimer

NOOP AI is not a medical device. Its health and training values are on-device estimates, not clinical
advice or diagnosis. Use it as a personal tool and consult a qualified professional for medical decisions.
