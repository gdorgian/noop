// The development / holdout split, and the reason it exists.
//
// Floor thresholds, recency weight, the kind prior, MMR, quotas, candidate depth, rerank depth, rerank-plus-
// recency, three relative-floor ratios, three embedding models and an untrained truncation have all been
// chosen by looking at scores on ONE corpus. That is roughly a dozen decisions fitted to 110 questions, and
// nothing so far has stopped the architecture from being shaped to this particular benchmark rather than to
// retrieval. A holdout is the only mechanism that catches that.
//
// Two properties matter more than the exact ratio:
//
//  * LEAK-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION. Splitting individual queries would scatter variants of one scenario across
//    both sides — the second ferritin value on dev, the third on test — and a model that had seen the
//    scenario would look like a model that generalised. Measured on this corpus, 48 of 110 queries grade
//    documents from more than one naive topic prefix, so prefix grouping cannot do it either. What does work
//    is the connected components of the query-document graph: two documents are joined when any query grades
//    both, so a whole scenario is indivisible. There are 51 such components here, the largest holding 15% of
//    queries.
//  * COMMITTED, NOT RECOMPUTED. The assignment lives in `Corpus/split.json`. If it were derived at run time,
//    every corpus edit would quietly move the boundary and the holdout would silently become contaminated by
//    everything measured before the move.
