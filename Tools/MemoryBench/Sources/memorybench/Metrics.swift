// stop that, because it answers the only question that matters — is this difference bigger than the corpus's
// own sampling error?

// PAIRED is the important word. Both variants answer the SAME queries, so the per-query differences carry far
// less variance than two independent means would, and the interval is correspondingly tighter. Comparing
// independent confidence intervals instead would throw that away and call almost everything inconclusive.
