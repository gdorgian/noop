//   memorybench embed  --corpus <dir> --model <gguf> --contract <id> --llama-embedding <bin> --out <dir>
//   memorybench models
//
// `score` needs no model, no device and no network: it replays the real index and the real fusion over
// vectors that `embed` produced earlier. `embed` is the only stage that touches a model, runs outside this
// repository, and writes build outputs that are never committed.
//
// No wearer's health data is involved at any point, and no NOOP database is opened.

usage: memorybench <score|embed|models|lint> [options]

  lint   --corpus <dir>
         Validates the corpus and prints its shape per language and category. No model, no vectors.

  score  --corpus <dir> --vectors <dir> [--floor 0.30,0.35,0.40] [--candidates 128]
         Replays the shipped index + fusion and every proposed variant. Deterministic.
         --synthetic replaces the vectors with hashed token bags: it exercises the whole
         pipeline with no model, and is NOT a measurement of any model.
         --rerank-server <url> adds cross-encoder rerank rows, scored through llama.cpp's
         own /rerank endpoint. Opt-in on purpose: without it `score` needs no network and
         stays deterministic, which is what lets CI run it.
         Reports the DEVELOPMENT half of `main` by default. --holdout "<reason>" also reports the
         frozen half and appends the access to Corpus/holdout-access.log.
         --mixed-language-index searches all ten locales at once. The default restricts
         candidates to the query's own language, because a real index holds one person's
         memories rather than nine translations of them — see Score.swift.

  embed  --corpus <dir> --contract <id> --model <gguf> --llama-embedding <bin> --out <dir>
         [--batch 32] [--dimensions N] [--separator <string>] [-- <extra llama-embedding args>]
         One run per model. Build `llama-embedding` from the tag pinned in Tools/bootstrap-nomic.sh.
         --dimensions overrides the stored width. For a model with trained Matryoshka this is a
         supported mode; for one without it, it is an EXPERIMENT whose result is the answer to
         "what does truncating this cost", and the run is labelled as untrained truncation.
         Before writing any vectors, `embed` scores three fixed trivial pairs through this model's
         own contract and REFUSES to proceed if any of them ranks the wrong document first — this
         is the check that would have caught multilingual-e5-small's broken Q4_K_M quant before it
         produced a plausible-looking nDCG@8. --skip-sanity-check overrides it for deliberate
         debugging of a model already known to be broken; the run is loudly marked as such.

  models List the known embedding contracts and which are comparable on the pinned runtime.

  golden [--fixtures <dir>] [--write]
         Checks (or with --write regenerates) Fixtures/tokeniser-golden.json, the fixture shared with
         StrandTests so the app's tokeniser/chunker and this tool's transcriptions of them cannot
         drift apart while both stay internally consistent.

  pareto --corpus <dir> --vectors <dirA> --vectors <dirB> [...]   (--vectors is repeatable)
         Prints quality beside index bytes, model size and embed time for several vector sets,
         and marks the Pareto front. No axis is weighted into a score, because a weight decides
         the ranking before the measurement does. Quality is the DEV half of `main` only.

  rebuild --corpus <dir> (--vectors <path> | --synthetic) [--fractions 0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0]
         What the coach receives while a model swap is still rebuilding the index. A swap calls
         `invalidate`, which marks every row of the old model `pending`, and `search` filters
         those out — so the index is genuinely part-empty for a while. The store's consistency
         during that is already covered by SemanticMemoryTests; this measures the QUALITY, which
         is what decides whether a rebuild may run in the background or needs a foreground
         notice.

  scale  --corpus <dir> (--vectors <path> | --synthetic) [--tiers 250,1000,5000]
         Answers the two questions a 272-document index cannot: is K=32 still enough when the
         history is twenty times longer, and how does the full-table scan grow. Filler is
         generated at RUN TIME as vectors — real corpus vectors pushed apart by noise calibrated
         to the corpus's own cosine spread — so nothing generated ever enters the corpus and
         nothing generated can ever reach a quality claim. It reproduces the geometry of a bigger
         index, not its semantics, so the K figure is a floor on real difficulty, not an estimate.

  split  --corpus <dir> [--test-fraction 0.35] [--seed N] [--regenerate] [--write]
         Assigns the `main` index to a development half and a frozen holdout. Whole scenarios move
         together — the connected components of the query-document graph — so no document can be
         graded from both sides. Without --write it only reports; with --write it commits
         Corpus/split.json, which is what makes the boundary stable across corpus edits.

         With a committed split.json it EXTENDS that assignment rather than recomputing: existing
         queries never move, only new scenarios are placed, and a new query that bridges the two
         halves is a hard error naming the query to regrade. `--regenerate` rebuilds from scratch
         and WILL move queries across the freeze, spending holdout queries and contaminating the
         holdout with tuned-on ones. It is almost never the right answer.
