        overlap heavily, no single threshold exists and the floor must be per-kind or
        relative to the top hit instead of absolute.

        This used to pool every query in the corpus, which is the worst place in the report
        for that mistake: this section is where the threshold is CHOSEN, so a pooled floor is
        fitted partly on the frozen holdout — leaking exactly what the split exists to
        prevent — and partly on ten 24-document locale sets whose cosines come from a much
        easier problem. Read the DEV row. The others are diagnostics.

        Absolute cosines are also not comparable BETWEEN models, so this is per model too: a
        floor calibrated on one and applied to another measures the mismatch, not the model.

        Tuning happens here and nowhere else. Floors, weights, candidate depths, rerank
        settings and model choice are all chosen on this half; the holdout stays frozen
        (see Corpus/split.json) and needs --holdout <reason> to appear at all, which is
        logged. Roughly a dozen decisions have already been fitted to this corpus, so
        without that separation the numbers would increasingly describe the benchmark
        rather than retrieval.

        Also deliberately NOT an average over the whole corpus: of \(answerableTotal) answerable
        queries \(answerableOnMain) sit on `main` and \(answerableTotal - answerableOnMain) on the
        ten 24-document locale sets, so a pooled mean is largely driven by a problem too easy to
        separate anything. (Computed, not carried — these counts were written out by hand once and
        went stale the first time the corpus grew.)

        nDCG@8 and P@8 exclude `unanswerable` (no ideal ranking), which is exactly why the
        abstention columns exist: the floor's largest measured effect never shows up in nDCG.
        `abst.` = share of unanswerable questions answered with NOTHING (higher is better).
        `f.abst` = share of ANSWERABLE questions wrongly answered with nothing — the price of
        every threshold, and without it a tighter floor looks free. `irrel.` = mean lines on an
        unanswerable question (target 0). `lines` = mean lines over all queries, so `P@8` can
        never be read alone: a pipeline that emits one correct line scores P@8 = 1.00, and only
        `lines` and `f.abst` reveal that it bought that by staying silent elsewhere.
