// MARK: - Which basal formula applied, and when
//
// `Calories` states the rule this file has to honour: NOOP must have ONE basal rate, because a second
// formula anywhere lets two screens disagree about the same body. That rule is about one rate per body
// per DAY. It does not forbid the formula from changing over time — it forbids the change from being
// ambiguous or retroactive.
//
// So the formula becomes DATA: an append-only list of (effectiveFrom, formula), seeded at the
// beginning of time with the revised Harris–Benedict the app has always used. Switching APPENDS an
// entry; nothing is ever edited or removed. The energy path asks "which formula applied on day X" and
// gets a deterministic answer from stored data rather than from whatever Settings currently says.
//
// WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Two surfaces consume the basal rate and they behave differently:
// `DailyMetric.activeKcalEst` bakes it in at scoring time, so old days already keep their value; but
// `EnergyEngine.summarize` recomputes on every build, so without this log a switch made today would
// silently rewrite yesterday's displayed history. The log exists for that second case.
//
// KATCH–MCARDLE IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY BETTER. It works from lean mass, so it beats a height/weight
// regression only when the body-fat number is good. Fed a Navy circumference estimate carrying ±4
// percentage points, its error can be comparable to what it replaced. The switch is therefore offered,
// never applied on NOOP's initiative, and the surface that offers it names what the number rests on —
// DEXA, scale, or tape.
