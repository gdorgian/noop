// MARK: - One session, opened up
//
// Everything else in this lane AGGREGATES: sets per muscle, volume per week, a trend per movement. This
// file does the opposite — it hands back the session exactly as it was performed, exercise by exercise
// and set by set, so the app can finally answer "what did I actually lift on Tuesday" without sending
// the user to another app to find out.
//
// It adds no new arithmetic beyond two things:
//
//   • the per-set e1RM, which is `OneRepMax.forSet` and already carries its own caveats;
//   • BODYWEIGHT LOAD, described below.
//
// ## Bodyweight load, and the number that is deliberately missing
//
// A pull-up logs as `weightKg: nil` (or as the ADDED weight when someone hangs a plate on a belt), so
// volume load counts a set of ten pull-ups as nothing. `volumeSetCount` beside it says the coverage is
// short, but a calisthenics day still reads as an easy one.
//
// What NOOP has that fixes this honestly is the wearer's own MEASURED body weight. So a bodyweight set
// is priced at the body weight recorded around that session — plus what was added, minus what was
// assisted — and reported as a SEPARATE figure that is never folded into `volumeLoadKg`.
//
// What is deliberately absent is a leverage factor: the convention that a push-up is "64 % of body
// weight" and a pull-up "100 %". Those numbers vary with limb length, hand position and where the
// wearer is in the movement, nobody has measured them for this person, and folding one in would put an
// invented constant inside a figure that is otherwise fully accounted for. So a push-up is priced at
// body weight like every other bodyweight movement, and the caption says the figure counts the body,
// not the share of it a given movement carries.
//
// With no measured body weight, the figure is simply absent. It is never estimated from height, age or
// anything else.

/// What shape a movement is logged in, from Hevy's own `type` token.
///
/// The token is a raw string in the model on purpose (Hevy does not enumerate it), so this is the one
/// place that interprets it. Everything unrecognised lands on `.other` and is treated as carrying no
/// bodyweight — the direction that under-reports rather than invents.
