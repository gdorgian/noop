// MomentumFeed.swift — which single thing is worth saying right now, and in what order the rest follow.
//
// The Today card this drives used to be hard-wired to one sentence ("HRV n% over baseline" plus a
// recovery word). It had no type, so nothing could hang off it: no tone, no icon, no action, no
// progress. Meanwhile the app already computes goal progress, weekly session counts, streaks, planned
// workouts, step baselines and sleep need — none of which could ever reach the card.
//
// This is the pure half: a message MODEL and a RANKING. It deliberately carries no user-facing text of
// its own — `headline` / `detail` / `actionLine` arrive already localized from the app layer, the same
// posture `BaseCardStatement` takes. That keeps this package free of a string catalog and keeps every
// rule here testable with plain strings, no app, no strap, no database.
//
// The ordering is the part people will argue about, so it is written down rather than left implicit:
//   tier 0 urgent  →  1 time-critical goal  →  2 personal goals  →  3 training/recovery
//                  →  4 progress            →  5 positive insight
// with a TIME-OF-DAY nudge that reorders only WITHIN a tier (the recovery read leads the morning, the
// activity read the afternoon, sleep and the week's goals the evening).

// MARK: - Model

/// kind added later has to state where it belongs rather than silently landing at the end.
