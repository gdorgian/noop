// MARK: - Balance — counting, not judging
//
// Three questions the set tally can answer by simple addition: how much pushing against how much
// pulling, how much upper body against how much lower, how much quad-dominant work against how much
// hip- and hamstring-dominant.
//
// ## The rule that keeps this honest
//
// NO TARGET RATIO IS SHIPPED. "Push and pull should be 1:1" is a coaching heuristic, not a measurement,
// and the moment a target appears on screen every reading becomes a pass or a fail against a number
// nobody validated for this wearer. What is offered instead is the same reference the rest of the
// Strength lane uses: THE WEARER'S OWN recent weeks, as a p25…p75 band. "1.6 : 1, and your usual is
// 1.1…1.4" is a fact about their training. "1.6 : 1, target 1.0" would be an opinion wearing a
// measurement's clothes.
//
// The groupings below ARE conventions — a triceps set counts as pushing, a biceps set as pulling — and
// they decide only how sets are ADDED UP. They are listed explicitly, in one place, so a reader can
// disagree with the grouping rather than having to reverse-engineer it out of a chart.
//
// Everything here counts PRIMARY muscle only, exactly like `hardSetsByMuscle`. Secondary involvement is
// not folded in with a fraction anywhere in this lane, and a balance figure is no place to start.
