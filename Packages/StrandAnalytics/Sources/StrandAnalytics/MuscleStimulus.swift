// MARK: - How much training stimulus each muscle actually took
//
// Counting working sets treats every set as one set. Three sets of ten at 20 kg then count the same as
// three sets at the edge of what you can lift — and for someone who benches 100 kg the first is close
// to nothing, while for someone who benches 25 kg it is a hard day. A map coloured by set count says
// "trained = orange" and little else.
//
// This estimates the STIMULUS instead, from what the log already carries: how heavy the set was
// relative to that person's own strength at the time, and how close to failure it was taken.
//
// ## This is an estimate, and the numbers below are chosen anchors
//
// The thresholds here (30 % and 70 % of one-rep max, the RPE ramp, half credit for indirect work) are
// conventions taken from how training volume is usually counted. They are NOT measurements, and no
// claim is made that a given number of stimulus units means anything physiological. What they buy is a
// figure that separates a warmup-weight set from a hard one, which set counting cannot do at all.
//
// Two consequences the callers must respect:
//
//   • **Nothing downstream may be gated on this.** It does not feed Charge, recovery, illness
//     detection or a coach recommendation. That is the project's rule for derived physiological
//     signals, and this one has had no validation beyond arithmetic.
//   • **Stimulus is never labelled as sets.** Indirect work adds credit, so the totals here are larger
//     than the sets actually performed. Showing both under one heading would make the same word mean
//     two things on one screen.
