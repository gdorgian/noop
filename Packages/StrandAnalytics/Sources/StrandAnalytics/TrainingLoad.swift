// MARK: - Training load, kept in the units each kind of training is actually measured in
//
// The question this answers: how much did this week ask of you, and is that unusual for you. The
// question it refuses: how much did lifting and cardio ask of you TOGETHER, as one number. There is no
// exchange rate between a heart-rate minute and a hard set, and inventing one is how a training-load
// score stops being a measurement.
//
// So there are three figures, deliberately separate:
//
//   • CARDIOVASCULAR LOAD — classic Edwards TRIMP, kept separate from Effort.
//   • STRENGTH LOAD — working sets, weighted by how close each went to failure.
//   • SESSION LOAD — session RPE × duration (Foster 1998), the athlete's own verdict on the whole
//     session. Not a fallback for the other two: a different question, answerable on days the set
//     data cannot describe.
//
// WHY NOT TONNAGE. Sets × reps × kilos looks like the obvious strength load and gets the ordering
// wrong. Four sets of ten at 100 kg is 4 000 kg; five triples at 180 kg is 2 700 kg — and the second
// session is the harder one, neuromuscularly and in what it costs to recover from. Tonnage rewards
// high-rep, sub-maximal work and reads a heavy top-end session as light. It offers a precision it does
// not have, so it stays a statistic on the Strength screen and is never the load.
//
// WHY SETS ARE BETTER THAN THEY SOUND. A plain count of WORKING sets — warmups excluded — tracks
// weekly fatigue surprisingly well, which is why hypertrophy research reports weekly set volume rather
// than tonnage. Its one real weakness is that it treats an easy set and a set to failure alike, and
// that is exactly what the effort weighting below fixes.
