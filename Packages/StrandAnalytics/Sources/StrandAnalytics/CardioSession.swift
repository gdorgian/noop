// MARK: - Cardio, in the units the sport is actually measured in
//
// The strength lane got a screen that says what a session held and whether it is moving. Cardio never
// had the equivalent: a run, a ride and a swim all arrived as "duration, average heart rate, calories",
// which is the one description under which they are indistinguishable. A 42-minute run says nothing
// until it says 7.6 km at 5:31 /km; a ride says nothing until it says 31 km/h.
//
// This file derives exactly the figures those questions need, and NOTHING that needs a model:
//
//   • pace and speed  — distance over time. Arithmetic on two measured quantities.
//   • beats per km    — average heart rate spent per kilometre covered. Also arithmetic, and the one
//                       figure here that is genuinely comparable across weeks for the same sport.
//   • weekly totals   — sessions, moving time, distance, calories, Effort.
//   • cardio load     — the session Effort values, compared with the wearer's own recent baseline.
//                       Effort is derived from heart-rate TRIMP; moving time remains a separate total.
//   • bests           — longest, farthest, fastest average pace within a band of session lengths.
//
// ## What is deliberately not here
//
// No "cardio fitness score", no VO2max estimate, no training-zone prescription, no "you should run
// slower". Beats per kilometre is offered as a MEASURED figure with an explicit warning attached at
// the call site: it moves with heat, hills, wind and sleep, so a single pair of sessions says nothing
// and the caller must present a trend or nothing at all.
//
// Splits are also absent, and that is a data limit rather than a choice: a stored `WorkoutRow` carries
// one distance and one duration, so a per-kilometre split would have to be invented by dividing them —
// which would draw a perfectly flat pace chart for a run that had none.
