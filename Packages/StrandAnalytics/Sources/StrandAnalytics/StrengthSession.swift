// MARK: - Strength derivations from Hevy sessions — pure, deterministic, DB-free
//
// What NOOP can honestly say about a logged strength session, and nothing more.
//
// THE GOVERNING RULE HERE IS RESTRAINT. There is no "strength score". A single number blending sets,
// volume, RPE and muscle groups would be arithmetic dressed as physiology: the weights would be
// invented, no published model backs them, and the reader could not tell which input moved it. Every
// figure below is instead one thing, computable from the log, and nameable in a sentence:
//
//   • working sets     — sets that were not warmups. A count, not a weighting.
//   • volume load      — Σ(weight × reps). Transparent, and it says so in the name.
//   • e1RM             — one published formula (Epley), applied only where it is defined.
//   • hard sets / group— counted on the PRIMARY muscle only. Secondary involvement is reported
//                        alongside, never folded in with a made-up fraction.
//   • RPE              — as logged, with coverage. Never imputed.
//
// The one place a convention could have crept in is the fractional-set idea (a secondary muscle counts
// as half a set). It is deliberately absent: the "0.5" has no measurement behind it, and it would make
// every per-muscle number look more precise than the log actually is.

/// The estimated one-rep maximum for a set.
///
/// **Epley**: `1RM = w · (1 + r/30)`. When a valid set RPE exists, `r` is completed reps plus the
/// corresponding reps in reserve (`10 − RPE`). This keeps two equally weighted sets from receiving
/// the same estimate when one stopped several repetitions earlier. Without a rating the published
/// completed-rep formula remains unchanged rather than guessing reserve.
///
/// It is an ESTIMATE and the surrounding UI must say so. Two guards keep it from pretending otherwise:
/// a single rep returns the weight itself (the formula's own +3.3% at r=1 is nonsense — a 1-rep max IS
/// the weight lifted), and above `maxRepsForEstimate` it returns nil rather than a number, because
/// rep-max formulas diverge badly in the high-rep range where fatigue, not maximal strength, sets the
/// limit. Nil is the honest answer there; a wrong number would quietly become a "PR".
