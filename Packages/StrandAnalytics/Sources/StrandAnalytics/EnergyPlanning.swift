// MARK: - Planning intake, without inventing a second calorie model
//
// `EnergyEngine`'s third rule is that sources are CHOSEN per day and never summed: two devices on one
// wrist measure the same body, and adding them invents a person who burned twice. A planner that
// derived its own burn from heart rate or steps would be exactly that second computation. So nothing
// here computes a burn. This file does three things instead:
//
//   1. Evaluates PAL conventions on top of a basal rate — a PREDICTION from a published formula,
//      which is a different question from what was measured, not a competing answer to it.
//   2. Summarises measured burn that already exists, with its provenance, and refuses to call a
//      mostly-modelled average "measured".
//   3. Puts the three available answers side by side and reports the spread.
//
// ON NOT WEIGHTING. It is tempting to average days with per-source weights. That would require
// inventing the weights, and an invented number that looks like evidence is worse than an honest
// filter. So the measured figure is a plain mean over days that MEET A STATED CRITERION, and the days
// that did not meet it are counted and shown rather than folded in at a discount.

/// A physical-activity-level multiplier applied to a basal rate.
///
/// These steps are CONVENTIONS, not measurements — the values are the ones the literature and every
/// calorie calculator quote, and a person does not actually come with a PAL of exactly 1.55. Every
/// surface showing them says so, the same treatment the Strength screen gives its stimulus anchors.
