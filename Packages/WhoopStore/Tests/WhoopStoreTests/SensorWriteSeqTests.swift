/// The analyze gate's change-detector contract (`WhoopStore.sensorWriteSeq`).
///
/// This is the test the two previous detectors did not have, and both failed for want of it:
///   - `hrFingerprint(deviceId:)` was scoped to ONE device id while the write side followed the
///     registry, so it stopped moving while data kept arriving and the re-score it guards silently
///     stopped running.
///   - a plain row COUNT moves back to an earlier value when a delete is followed by a re-sync of the
///     same rows, which reads as "nothing changed" for the same silent result.
///
/// So the contract under test is exactly: **every sensor mutation moves the sequence, and the
/// sequence never moves backwards** — regardless of which device id the rows are written under.
